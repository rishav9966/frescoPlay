1. Multiple Inheritance
Create two interfaces: HockeyTeam and FootballTeam, and one class: Sport. The Sport class should implement both the interfaces HockeyTeam and FootballTeam (Multiple Inheritance).

 

The HockeyTeam interface must contain the following methods:

 

public int calculateHockeyScore();
public int findHighestGoalByIndividualInHockey(); 
 

The FootballTeam must contain the following methods:

 

public int calculateFootballScore();
public int findHighestGoalByIndividualInFootball(); 
 

Class Sport must contain the variables int[] hockeyPlayers, int[] footballPlayers.

 

Sport(int[] paramHockeyPlayers, int[] paramFootballPlayers): Constructor takes two arrays as parameters and initializes the empty array hockeyPlayers to store the first 11 integer values, and the empty array footballPlayers to store the last 11 integer values. Assign each value to each element in hockeyPlayers and footballPlayers.
public int calculateHockeyScore(): Calculate the overall score by adding the scores of all individual hockeyPlayers in the hockey team, and return the overall score as an integer.
public int calculateFootballScore(): Calculate the overall score by adding the scores of all individual footballPlayers in the football team, and return the overall score as an integer.
public int findHighestGoalByIndividualInHockey(): Find the highest goal scorer in the hockey team, and return the number of goals scored as an integer. 
public int findHighestGoalByIndividualInFootball(): Find the highest goal scorer in the football team, and return the number of goals scored as an integer. 
 

The locked code stub validates the implementation of the Sport class, and the HockeyTeam and FootballTeam interfaces.

 

Input format for Custom Testing:

 

The first line contains 11 space-separated integers (goals of players in the hockey team).
The last line contains 11 space-separated integers (goals of players in the football team).
 

Sample Input:

 

2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
2 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Sample Output:

Output Specification:

 

The first line contains the overall score of the hockey team.
The second line contains the overall score of the football team.
The third line contains the goals scored by the highest goal scorer in the hockey team.
The last line contains the goals scored by the highest goal scorer in the football team.
